##  This python project has developed a very simple ai chatbot that utilizes the natural learninig process (NLP) using the nltk libraries in the Python program. The chatbot is fairly simple and thats was can recognise predefined patterns and responses while also understanding the basic queries of the users.This bot responds based on basic predefined patterns and identifies the keywords to response to basic general greetings. The chatbot.py script is the collection of the bots knowledge and the whole interface of using the bot is just text based as it only performs light tasks like responding to the prompts, still the experience stays interactive.The nltk library is very crucial for this program as it is the core of the chatbots brain which is behind the identification of keywords and patterns of the user's input and forming suitable responses.
